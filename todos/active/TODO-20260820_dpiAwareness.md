# Make Skyline DPI-aware (scouting)

## Branch Information
- **Branch**: `Skyline/work/20260820_dpiAwareness` (pwiz1)
- **Base**: `master`
- **Created**: 2026-08-20
- **Status**: In Progress
- **GitHub Issue**: [#4599](https://github.com/ProteoWizard/pwiz/issues/4599)
- **Module**: `skyline`
- **PR**: (pending)

## Objective

Skyline declares no DPI awareness (`Properties/app.manifest` still has the
commented-out VS template `dpiAware` element - never enabled, confirmed via
`git log -S dpiAware`), so Windows renders it at 96 DPI and bitmap-stretches
the window on scaled displays. Developer screenshot comparison vs Excel shows
pronounced blur. This scouting phase flips the manifest to system-DPI-aware
on a branch and inventories the breakage to size the real fix.

## Strategy (agreed with developer 2026-08-20)

1. **Scouting (this branch)**: system-DPI-aware manifest + app.config; run at
   125%/150%; catalog layout/owner-draw/icon breakage.
2. **System-DPI-aware release**: fix the inventory, full dialog audit at 150%.
   Fixes single-monitor high-DPI blur (the reported case).
3. **Per-monitor V2** (Excel parity): tied to the .NET 8 port
   (`TODO-20260612_net8_port`) - WinForms PMv2 on 4.7.2 is incomplete and
   DigitalRune docking / ZedGraph do not handle `WM_DPICHANGED`.
   `<gdiScaling>` was considered and rejected as a destination (GDI text only;
   ZedGraph charts are GDI+ and would stay blurry).

## Known impact areas to check

- Forms with `AutoScaleMode.None` or hardcoded pixel layouts.
- Owner-drawn controls: Targets tree (SrmTreeView), sequence/associate grids,
  custom renderers.
- ZedGraph panes + LabelLayout pixel math (should be DPI-agnostic - it
  measures real pixels - but verify at 150%).
- DigitalRune docking panels.
- 16x16 icons: sharp but small after the flip; higher-res assets are a
  follow-up.
- Tests/tooling: nightly agents run at 100% (unaffected); developers onscreen
  at 125%+ would newly see scaled geometry - affects LabelLayoutTest English
  pins and tutorial screenshot capture (96 DPI assumption).

## Tasks

- [ ] Flip `Properties/app.manifest` to system-DPI-aware +
      `EnableWindowsFormsHighDpiAutoResizing` in app.config
- [ ] Build; launch at developer's scale factor; first-pass inventory
      (main window, key dialogs)
- [ ] Broader dialog sweep at 125%/150%; record findings here
- [ ] Effort estimate for the system-aware pass; report on issue #4599
