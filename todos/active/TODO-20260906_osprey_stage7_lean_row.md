# TODO-20260906_osprey_stage7_lean_row.md - Stage 7 (SecondPassFDR) holds ~274 B objects where 88 B of row would serve

**Module**: `osprey`
**Status**: Not started - branch created, no commits yet
**Branch**: `Skyline/work/20260906_osprey_stage7_lean_row` in `C:\proj\pwiz-work1`,
cut from `c4921f3d6c` (master with #4633 merged). Local only - not pushed, no PR yet.
**Predecessor**: `todos/completed/TODO-20260901_osprey_stage5_reload_materialization.md`,
merged as [#4633](https://github.com/ProteoWizard/pwiz/pull/4633) / `c4921f3d6c` on 2026-09-06.

This is the work the predecessor was opened to reach. That TODO grew to cover everything that
had to be true FIRST - per-phase artifact durability, bounded Stage 6 planning, the
`--model-diagnostics` render, and getting the gate green and affordable again - and it has now
shipped. **Detail lives in the predecessor; this file carries only what is still open.** Do not
duplicate its sections here - cite them.

## The goal

Carry a **446-file analysis to completion with bounded memory** on a 63.7 GB box, and ideally
scale to **1000 runs** on the same hardware.

## THE ACCEPTANCE CRITERION (developer, 2026-09-02) - carried forward verbatim

> *"I would like to see both FDR tasks lower memory and SecondPass lower than FirstPass, because
> it is dealing with a much smaller bounded set of entries."*

Box-independent, and cannot be satisfied by adding RAM:

* FirstPassFDR processes the full PRE-compaction pool - 1,342,686,095 entries at 446 runs.
* SecondPassFDR processes only the survivors - 288,920,200. About **4.6x smaller**, and bounded.
* **A stage doing strictly less work must not peak higher.**

**The pass/fail test on any future perfviz plot: if Stage 7 is the tallest region, the goal is
not met even when the run completes.** The 257-file plot of 2026-08-24 shows the inversion -
SecondPassFDR ~70 GB against FirstPassFDR's ~55 GB - and that inversion IS the diagnosis:
Stage 7's cost is its REPRESENTATION, not its workload.

## What is still open

| # | item | where the analysis lives (predecessor TODO) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Stage 7 holds ~274 B `FdrEntry` objects rebuilt from parquet where 88 B of fixed-width row would serve | "THE STAGE 7 HANDOFF SHOULD BE A LEAN SIDECAR, NOT A LEAN STRUCT"; "The three-axis Stage 7 plan"; "THE STAGE 7 SIDECAR READ, and two corrections to the three-axis plan" |
| 2 | Measured cost to beat: **78.3 GB committed, ~240 MB/file at 446** | "STAGE 7 AT 446 FILES: 78.3 GB COMMITTED, ~240 MB/FILE (measured 2026-09-04)" |
| 3 | **Coupling 3** - pass-2 diagnostics read the whole-run survivor pool. The only one of the four memory couplings still open; it belongs with this work | predecessor's coupling table |
| 4 | Where the lean row does and does not apply | "Where the lean row does and does not apply to this work" |

## What the predecessor cleared out of the way

Recorded so this work does not re-litigate settled ground:

* **Per-phase durability**: model at training, protein-compact stratum at protein FDR, per-file
  `.1st-pass.fdr_scores.bin` in pass 1. A run interrupted after training re-enters at the
  compaction gate instead of repeating the score passes.
* **Stage 6 planning is bounded**: two per-file passes over the survivor loader instead of an
  all-files buffer. 30.89 -> 12.91 GB peak managed at 86 files, compaction boundary identical.
* **`--model-diagnostics` no longer pins the all-runs hydrate.** This was a stated MEMORY
  prerequisite for the lean row, not just a correctness one - it is now a render over retained
  per-pass products, verified to fold identically from the live score-pass sink and from the
  on-disk sidecars at 446 runs (exact match, 18,821 payload leaves).
* **Coupling 4 (peak co-assignment) is CLOSED as a non-issue** - characterised as a time term,
  not an O(runs) memory term. Do not re-open it as a memory item.
* **The gate is green and affordable**: `-Dataset All` is 1:06 on MacCoss TeamCity Agent 1 under
  the two-lane runner, with modes 8 and 9 now running on every dataset.

## Before starting

* Read `ai/docs/osprey-development-guide.md` on the two-lane gate - `-Dataset All` no longer
  costs double a Stellar-only run, so run the full gate rather than Stellar as a stand-in.
* The per-dataset coverage matrix and the reason for each asymmetry are in that same guide,
  beside the dataset table. Astral omits mode 2 deliberately; that is budgeted, not an oversight.
